Hi, I’m Timmy. I live here in Omaha and I focus on helping small businesses tighten up their cybersecurity — things like Wi-Fi, passwords, backups, and basic protections.

I’m not here to sell you any software today. I’m doing short, focused security assessments for local businesses so you know:
- where you’re strong,
- where you’re exposed,
- and what simple fixes would make the biggest difference.

It takes about 20–30 minutes. I ask you a few questions, look at how your internet and devices are set up, and then I put it into a simple summary and 30/60/90 day action plan that you can keep.

Is that something you’d be open to doing today or scheduling for another time?
