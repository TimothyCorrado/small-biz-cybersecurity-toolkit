## Important Context for This Report
This assessment is **not a pass/fail audit**.

Most small businesses of similar size have comparable gaps.  
The purpose of this report is to **identify practical, prioritized improvements** that reduce risk without disrupting daily operations.

---

## Executive Summary (Plain English)
This report provides a high-level snapshot of **{{BUSINESS_NAME}}**’s cybersecurity posture.

Overall, the business demonstrates **several strong security practices already in place**, particularly around staff processes and basic device protection.  
However, a small number of **high-priority risks** were identified that could increase exposure to ransomware, data loss, or operational downtime if left unaddressed.

The good news:  
Most recommended improvements are **low-cost configuration changes**, not major technology purchases.
