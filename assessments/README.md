## 🔐 SMB Cybersecurity Level System

This repository uses a **responsibility-based level system** to track real-world growth in SMB (Small & Medium Business) cybersecurity consulting.

This is **not gamification**.  
It exists to clearly define **when it is appropriate to take on more trust, responsibility, and eventually paid work**.

---

### How the system works

Progression is based on:
- Real SMB exposure  
- Repeatable assessment experience  
- Ethical readiness to charge  
- Increasing responsibility and risk ownership  

Levels are **not time-based** and **not certification-only**.

---

### Level Overview (High Level)

- **Level 0–1:** Learning & foundations  
  *No business interaction*

- **Level 2:** Simulated execution  
  *Checklists, templates, reports, practice conversations*

- **Level 3:** Real SMB assessments (free / pilot)  
  *Conversation-only, real reports, real owner feedback*

- **Level 4:** Paid assessments  
  *Repeatable process, predictable findings, ethical charging*

- **Level 5+:** Trusted consultant → senior → lead  
  *Strategic advice, referrals, long-term relationships*

Each level explicitly defines:
- What work is appropriate  
- What risk is being carried  
- Whether charging is ethical at that stage  

---

### Why this exists

Most early consultants:
- Charge too early  
- Skip real-world reps  
- Cannot clearly explain their readiness  

This system enforces:
- **Repetition before monetization**
- **Clear boundaries around trust**
- **Accountability for real-world exposure**

It mirrors how consulting firms develop talent — made explicit and documented.

### How it’s used in this repository

- Assessment templates align with the current level  
- Simulated and real assessments are documented as evidence  
- Progression reflects **work completed**, not titles claimed
