# Firewall Lab – Purpose

This lab exists to understand how network security controls enforce policy,
generate logs, and support security decisions.

The initial focus is on responsibility:
- What the provider secures
- What the customer secures
- How misconfigurations lead to risk

This aligns with the Azure shared responsibility model.
