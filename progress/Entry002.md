Game planning for this next year (2026)

12/30/2025: Honeypot logs & analysis will be the next task for me to do, since from my research this will be the highest impact for my growth, as well as doing the real world SMB assessments. I will be doing both at the beginning of 2026.

GOAL: build my knowledge and get experience at the same time. Then getting paid for it while I gain experience.
