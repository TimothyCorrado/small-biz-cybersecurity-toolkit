Officially the new year. Gameplanning for @HONEYPOT-01

## Planning
- Initialize repo structure for a honeypot lab
- Add Cowrie docker-compose deployment
- Create runbook + evidence folders + export script

## Why it matters
- Demonstrates practical attack telemetry collection and triage workflows
- Produces recruiter-friendly artifacts (CSV exports + evidence trail)

## Next steps after that
- Start honeypot and verify logs generate
- Capture real attempts (or simulate safely from a test box)
- Build summary script: top IPs, top usernames/passwords, common commands

Applied to 10 different jobs on linkedin, looking at requirements needed for some positions. Set up a reminder to reach out to employers to check on the status of applications. Should be another way to set myself apart from the competition.

Tracking my crypto through a google sheet, and using the crypto portfolio I created to view and take screenshots of. Plan to generate crypto as I go, and put money to the side each week, while I work Lyft and go business to business locally to do assessments.

Goal is to get a real assessment done tomorrow, working to get past conflicts
