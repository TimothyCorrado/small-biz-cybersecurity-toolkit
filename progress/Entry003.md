Officially the new year. Gameplanning for @HONEYPOT-01

## Planning
- Initialize repo structure for a honeypot lab
- Add Cowrie docker-compose deployment
- Create runbook + evidence folders + export script

## Why it matters
- Demonstrates practical attack telemetry collection and triage workflows
- Produces recruiter-friendly artifacts (CSV exports + evidence trail)

## Next steps after that
- Start honeypot and verify logs generate
- Capture real attempts (or simulate safely from a test box)
- Build summary script: top IPs, top usernames/passwords, common commands

Applied to 10 different jobs on linkedin, looking at requirements needed for some positions. Set up a reminder to reach out to employers to check on the status of applications. Should be another way to set myself apart from the competition.
