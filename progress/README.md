# 📅 Progress Folder (Internal Notes & Daily Work)

This folder contains **internal, analyst-style working notes** used during the development of this cybersecurity portfolio.  
Unlike `CONTRIBUTION_LOG.md`, which is polished and recruiter-friendly, the **progress folder is intentionally informal**.

Think of it as my personal SOC analyst notebook.

---

## 🧭 Purpose of This Folder

The progress folder is used for:

- Daily work logs  
- Rough drafts  
- Experiments  
- Task planning  
- Internal checklists  
- Tag-based work notes  
- Unpolished screenshots  
- Partial ideas  
- Anything “in progress”  

This allows you to work quickly and naturally without worrying about presentation.

## 🔍 How It Differs From `CONTRIBUTION_LOG.md`

| `progress/` | `CONTRIBUTION_LOG.md` |
|------------|------------------------|
| Internal notes | Public-facing summary |
| Raw, unpolished | Clean, professional |
| Daily details | Major milestones |
| Freeform writing | Structured format |
| Tags allowed anywhere | Tags allowed only in commit logs & entries |
| Not designed for recruiters | Designed *for* recruiters |

Both systems work together:

- `progress/` captures your **real work**.  
- `CONTRIBUTION_LOG.md` captures your **high-level growth**.  

This mirrors what actual SOC teams and consultants do:  
Private analyst notes + public documentation.

## ✍️ Recommended Usage

Inside this folder, you can:

- Create `Entry01.md`, `Entry02.md`, etc.  
- Or use named logs like `Day01.md` if preferred  
- Track learning, fixes, ideas, progress  
- Draft analysis before moving it to its final folder  
- Use **any tag** (including `@ULTRA-ELITE-01`) freely  

There are **no format rules** here — this is your space to think.

## 🧪 Examples of Good Use

You might use this folder for things like:

- Rough notes on building a KQL query  
- Drafting a phishing analysis before polishing it  
- Notes from a TryHackMe room  
- reminders for what to do tomorrow  
- internal debugging notes  
- snippets you plan to convert into automation scripts  
- brainstorms for the flagship case study  

If it’s messy, that means you’re using it correctly.
